# A `HITS`-based search engine

Google uses PageRank.  HITS is just like PageRank, except it figures out how to automatically deal with spider-traps AND deadends.  Way cool.

# To Run

1. Unpack the dependencies by running `setup-dependencies.sh`.

# Cleanup

1. Dependencies can be removed with `remove-dependencies.sh`.
