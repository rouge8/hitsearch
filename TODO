Come up with better way to organize TODO system
    Tickets/issues?  could we use github?
PARTS:
    WebCrawler: able to learn the organization and structure of an internet
        - pull out links to other pages
        - generate keywords for pages for searching
        - save work:
            - in such a way that allows us to not need to crawl more than we have to
            _ maybe be able to have inexpensive 'just-update-whats-new' crawls
    HITS algorithm:  take data from webcrawler, generate rankings of pages
    Query parser: take user input, figure out how to query the engine
    Search Engine: take a query, get a list of relevant pages, and rank them with the (pre-computed) HITS ranks
    Views:  probably just make it a textfield with a button, etc etc.

    It'd be cool if we could design this in a way that Carleton or other sites could easily adopt it for their own use, but eh-- whatever
