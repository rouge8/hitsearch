    stop words in query:
        solution!
            remove stop words
        if the query is then empty, put them all back in
            (or put them back in in order of descending stoppiness?)
        say which words were ignored
DOCUMENTATION:

ADMINPAGE:
    add a button for the crawler and program some crawler feedback so we can see its status
        button..
        status..
            maybe make it write to a logfile?
CRAWLER:
    parallel crawling
        threads should actually wait till all other threads are waiting, then they all die at once
            ###right now a thread crawls until the pages_to_visit queue is empty, and then it'll quit.
            ###this means as soon as the queue is empty, but pages are still downloading stuff, all of the threads but the active ones will die
        in the wait state, they should wake up when anything gets put in the queue
