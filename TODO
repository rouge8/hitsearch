QUERY:
    stop words in query:
        solution!
            remove stop words
        if the query is then empty, put them all back in
            (or put them back in in order of descending stoppiness?)
        say which words were ignored

CRAWLER:
    include link text in word_counts, even of pages that are never parsed
    this means they will actually be able to show up in our results, even if it is unlikely
